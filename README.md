### [AI Product/Service Ideation Task](https://github.com/ixfirdaus22/FeynnLabsInternship2024/blob/main/Sports%20Match-Forming%20App/Product%20Report.pdf)
For this solo project, the final concept is a Machine Learning and AI-powered sports match-forming app that uses advanced machine learning algorithms to match players based on skill levels, availability, and location. It features a dynamic user ranking system that adjusts based on real-time performance, offering users a competitive and engaging experience. The app also includes a user-friendly interface that allows for manual adjustments, giving players control over their matches while benefiting from AI-driven recommendations. This repository provides a basic code implementation for the sports matchmaking app, including some visualizations, simple EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), and ML modeling.
